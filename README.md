**AutoML-SimpleXGBoost**

A simplified AutoML pipeline that performs automated preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning using XGBoost for classification, regression, and multi-class problems. This project also includes data inspection tools, handling for time series, and GUI support (Tkinter or Flask-ready).

Features

✅ Automated handling of missing values (mean, median, zero, drop, mode, missing-label)

📊 Pre-analysis of missing value patterns in training and test datasets

📦 Support for binary, multi-class classification, and regression

📈 Log-transform option for regression targets

🔁 Time series split for sequential data

🔎 Auto-detection of problem type based on target distribution

🎯 Built-in hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian Search (BayesSearchCV)

🧪 Integration-ready with GUI (e.g., Tkinter, Flask)
